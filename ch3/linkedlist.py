    Let's make a list. I'm hungry, so it's gonna be fruits.

        >>> fruits = LinkedList()

    Add a node to be the head:

        >>> fruits.append("apple")
        >>> fruits.head
        <Node apple>
        >>> fruits.tail
        <Node apple>

    Now let's add some more:

        >>> fruits.append("berry")
        >>> fruits.tail
        <Node berry>
        >>> fruits.head.next
        <Node berry>
        >>> fruits.tail.prev
        <Node apple>

        >>> fruits.append("cherry")
        >>> fruits.append("dragonfruit")
        >>> fruits.append("eggplant")
        >>> fruits.append("fig")

    I think I want to eat the apple first.

       >>> fruits.remove("apple")

    What's left?

        >>> fruits.display()
        berry
        cherry
        dragonfruit
        eggplant
        fig

    Now a fig.

        >>> fruits.remove("fig")

    What's left?

        >>> fruits.display()
        berry
        cherry
        dragonfruit
        eggplant

    Okay, cherries are awesome.

        >>> fruits.remove("cherry")

    What's left?

        >>> fruits.display()
        berry
        dragonfruit
        eggplant

    Let's save those for later.
